Just saw O'Dessa and honestly, I'm not sure what just happened. It's like my brain was put in a blender and set on purée. Walked back home and it's still spinning. The plot? Well, there was one, I think. It's fuzzy now, like trying to remember a dream where you sort of had a birt𝘏𝘋ay party but all the presents were stale bagels. Or were they?

The characters were, um, interesting? There’s that one guy who looked like my high school gym teacher if he'd been cast as a reluctant hero—sweaty, confused, kinda heroic in a how did I get here? way. And the music! Holy cymbals, Batman, whoever did the sound track deserves some kind of medal. Or maybe just a hearty handshake. It was like the universe having a rock opera in its living room.

> Halfway through, I kinda zoned out and started thinking about what penguins do on their days off. Like, do they do 𝘕𝘦𝘵𝘧𝘭𝘪𝘹? Or do they just stand around looking purposefully lost like I was at the climax of the 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮?

Oh, and there's this glowing orb thing they kept cutting back to. Have to admit, I was more invested in that than any of the human characters. I kept expecting it to reveal some profound truth about existence. Spoiler: it just kept glowing.

My buddy came along and predictably, he’s 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥𝘪𝘯𝘨 the   later. He's that kind of guy. Adjusts his glasses like he's 𝘤𝘳𝘢𝘤𝘬ing the enigma code every time something remotely clever happens onscreen. Me? I'll 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   again only if someone promises me unlimited popcorn and a quiz on planetary geology, because why not.

Here's some random code that means nothing but feels right here:

```
int O_dessa_feature() {
    for(int i = 0; i < mind_boggle; i++){
        if(brain.cells->dissolve())
            return confusion_level++;
    }
    return -1;
}
```

In the end, did I like O'Dessa? In a way, maybe. It’s like finding an old mixtape in your drawer—you might not remember why you made it, but there’s a nostalgic tug there. It’s a lovely, chaotic mess, and if anything, it reminded me that sometimes being puzzled is more fun than having all the answers.
